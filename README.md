# Our Audition Repository

Welcome to our Audition Repository. We're always looking for the best and the brightest to join our team and help democratize access to opportunities around the world.

We encourage people to move between the front-end, back-end, mobile, infra, etc. and develop a well-rounded set of skills - but if you're interested in applying, to be able to put your best foot forward choose one of the areas of focus below for your Audition.

## Front-End

Here at Spacely's Sprockets, we're processing applications for new employees. In order to process them efficiently we need your help.

## Back-End

Here at Spacely's Sprockets, we're building the future of Electric Vehicles! To build them right, we've included a ton of sensors that monitor everything from bumpiness to loudness of the ride. Help us process the data from those sensors efficiently to let us know when our vehicles need service!
